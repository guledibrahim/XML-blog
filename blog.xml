<post>Arsenal have won their first away game against Manchester City since 2012, who have slipped against their title rival chelsea with a first half penalty put away by Santi Cazorla. Arsene Wenger tactical master plan was executed perfectly by siting back and being compact and hitting quick counter attacks on the break. A quick second half goal scored by Giroud to extend Arsenal leads. The match was very entertaining (of course being Arsenal fan) and seeing my team win away for the first in a long time. Manchester City have a tough away game against their title rival Chelsea which will be an exciting match.

<post>Her royal Higness Queen Elizabeth II visited the Tower of London to see the grand dispaly of poppies to honour the soldiers who fought. Amid the sea of ceramic blood red poppies, Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh laid their own wreath to commemorate the dead. The creator, ceramic artist Paul Cummins, will fill the evolving installation with 888,246 poppies, honouring each British and Colonial soldier that died during the war.

<post>Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz has died, royal officials have announced, weeks after he was admitted to hospital.
Abdullah, who had ruled since 2005 and was said to be aged about 90, had been suffering from a lung infection. His 79-year-old half-brother, Salman, has been confirmed as the new king. Within hours of his accession to the throne of the oil-rich kingdom, King Salman vowed to maintain the same policies as his predecessors. "We will continue adhering to the correct policies which Saudi Arabia has followed since its establishment," he said in a speech broadcast on state television. Abdullah had suffered frequent bouts of ill health in recent years, and King Salman had recently taken on the ailing monarch's responsibilities.
